# Arrays and Objects


## Array
`a = []` is a list.



## Object
`o = {}` has properties.
for instance, `age:` 56, `key:` value

Many programming languages allow programmers to creat `"objects"` in their code.
* In real life, an object is a `"thing"` or noun that has many properties associated with it.
* `For example:` student, course, customer, policy.

### Once you figure out what `object` you want to model, you can assign properties:
* For example, an `Employee` might have the following properties:
  * employeeId
  * name
  * jobTitle
  * payRate

# JS Objects:
* JS allows you to declare objects with value for each property.
* Properties are written as names and value pairs that are separated by a colon.
  - {`name:` "Abel", `employeeId:` "1",}
